    Employee Handbook - Vacation Policy
    
    All full-time employees are entitled to 15 days of paid vacation annually. 
    Part-time employees receive vacation days prorated based on hours worked. 
    Vacation days accrue monthly and can be used after 90 days of employment.
    
    Unused vacation days may be carried over to the next calendar year, up to 
    a maximum of 5 days. Days exceeding this limit will be forfeited. Employees 
    are encouraged to use their vacation time to maintain work-life balance.
    
    Vacation requests must be submitted through the HR portal at least 2 weeks 
    in advance. Requests are subject to manager approval based on business needs. 
    Peak season requests may require additional notice.
